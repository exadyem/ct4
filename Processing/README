List of when made/uploaded/version

1.      kitty.pde is the first time working with Processing, and is mostly me trying to figure out how it works. In my portfolio I refer to this one as "Bacon" - no clue why, but it's cute.

2.      garfield.pde is the happy version of the orange cat I want to use for my personal project, I struggled a bit with the smile, but in the end I think it's cute - especially since I'm certainly not the most skilled yet.

3.      garfield_sad.pde is the sad version of the orange cat I made, a big frown to go along with his big double chin. We love him anyway, and we'll do anything to make our Garfield happy again.
