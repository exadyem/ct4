List of when made/uploaded/version

1.      kitty.pde is the first time working with Processing, and is mostly me trying to figure out how it works. In my portfolio I refer to this one as "Bacon" - no clue why, but it's cute.

2.      garfield.pde is the happy version of the orange cat I want to use for my personal project, I struggled a bit with the smile, but in the end I think it's cute - especially since I'm certainly not the most skilled yet.

3.      garfield_sad.pde is the sad version of the orange cat I made, a big frown to go along with his big double chin. We love him anyway, and we'll do anything to make our Garfield happy again.

4.      test.pde was when I was experimenting with how the text input would change the image, however in this version I was very much stuck with the .contains not taking a list of strings, but it did take them one by one. Not exactly what I want, though. With that, there's parts in this file of code that isn't used anywhere currently, however I thought (at first) I could use it instead of the String a1.

5.      messy_garfield.pde and messy_garfield_sad.pde are both more up to date files of the original (mentioned in point 1 and 2), however in messy_garfield.pde there is lots of messy code that I wrote before moving over to test.pde. There's random bits and pieces of code that is irrelevant now. These two files were mostly used to receive a png image from the sketches to use for the test.pde once the text input works properly.

6.      textInput.pde and evaluate.pde are two codes that I used to help me with the final code. These codes were found online and weren't made by me, just people with similar issues. I took most of the inspiration from these codes, however parts I did need to adjust to fit my idea better.
